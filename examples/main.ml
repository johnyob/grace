(* Grace provides support for error codes.
   Instead of simply using strings, Grace stores error codes as arbitrary types (e.g. variants).

   This permits us to define a set of short error codes that are meaningful to the user, while
   still being able to match on the underlying variant when inspecting diagnostics. *)
