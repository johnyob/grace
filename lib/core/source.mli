(** Grace provides the abstraction of a file called a 'source'.

    There are several benefits with providing a in-memory abstraction of a sources:
    + {b Virtual files}: It is often useful to invent temporary files (e.g. test input, command line input, REPL input). By providing a in-memory abstraction, Grace provides the ability to create virtual files.
    + {b Caching}: Caching sources is useful in many situations (e.g. LSP semantic analysis, reporting multiple errors in a single file in a diagnostic reporter, etc). *)
